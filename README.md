# MQTT Communication and LAMP Configuration

This repository contains a project that combines communication using the MQTT protocol and a LAMP configuration for a web interface.

## Project description

The objective of this project is to develop a web application that uses MQTT for communication between IoT devices and a central server. Additionally, a LAMP configuration is implemented for data management and presentation via a web interface.
## Main components
### MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport)

The MQTT protocol is used for communication between IoT devices and the central server. It provides an efficient and lightweight way to send messages between devices, with a focus on low bandwidth utilization and reliability on bandwidth-limited networks.

### LAMP Settings

The LAMP configuration consists of:

- **Linux**: Base operating system for the server.
- **Apache**: Web server to host the web interface and manage HTTP requests.
- **MySQL**: Database management system to store and manage data generated by IoT devices.
- **PHP**: Programming language for the development of web application logic and interaction with the database.

### Web Interface

The web interface provides a way to view and manage data generated by IoT devices. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to create an intuitive and friendly interface for the end user.
